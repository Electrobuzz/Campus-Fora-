The HTML, CSS and React file is in the Repo.
Although it is not even close to what I thought coz the CSS and React part isn't working (i think and i don't know why).
it is only html skeleton of website :(
I've learned HTML , CSS , react in 1 day and 1 night only so please consider my work
I really want to work on this project .
